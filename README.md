# FlowGate

FlowGate is a TCP Proxy tool designed for monitoring, intercepting, and manipulating network traffic. The proxy acts as a middleman between a client and a server, providing real-time analysis and modification capabilities. Built for developers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and penetration testers, FlowGate offers a flexible platform for traffic inspection and debugging.

## Features

- **Traffic Redirection**: Redirects TCP traffic between clients and servers.
- **Live Traffic Monitoring**: Real-time display of bytes transmitted.
- **Data Interception**: Capture, log, and modify data on-the-fly.
- **Multi-Threaded Architecture**: Handles multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Easily configurable to match your needs.

## Installation

To run FlowGate, make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can install the necessary dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Launch the proxy by specifying the local and remote hosts and ports. You can run FlowGate using the following command:

```bash
python flowgate.py --local-host 127.0.0.1 --local-port 9999 --remote-host www.example.com --remote-port 80
```

### Command-Line Options

- `--local-host`: Specifies the local IP address to bind the proxy.
- `--local-port`: Sets the local port to listen for incoming connections.
- `--remote-host`: Target server to forward the traffic.
- `--remote-port`: Port of the target server.

## Examples

### Basic Proxy Usage

```bash
python flowgate.py --local-host 127.0.0.1 --local-port 9999 --remote-host www.example.com --remote-port 80
```

In the above example, FlowGate intercepts traffic at `127.0.0.1:9999` and forwards it to `www.example.com:80`. You can configure your web browser or any application to use `127.0.0.1:9999` as a proxy to see the traffic.

### Advanced Configuration

You can customize FlowGate to modify packets before they reach the destination server. Example coming soon!
